# JDecentral
Embrace the Power of Decentralized Journalism
## Inspiration
Traditional journalism platforms frequently encounter obstacles associated with centralization, censorship, and a dearth of transparency. Users are often afforded limited agency over their disseminated articles, while apprehensions arise concerning data integrity and the genuineness thereof.
## What it does
Our project is a decentralized journalist platform built on Hedera Hashgraph Consensus Service (HCS). It leverages Hedera Consensus Service for storing and retrieving articles. The platform provides an immutable and transparent environment for journalists to publish their articles while ensuring data integrity and ownership.
## How we built it
To create an intuitive user interface, we developed the frontend using React, Material UI and TailwindCSS. The backend, powered by Node.js and Express, 
manages all requests, integrates the Hedera SDK, and uses MongoDB to store login credentials. 
The Hedera HashGraph ensures the immutability and transparency of published articles, while data is fetched from Hedera's mirror nodes, accessible to 
everyone.
## Challenges we ran into
During the development process, we faced challenges in integrating the Hedera SDK and understanding the intricacies of HCS. Moreover, we encountered challenges while developing dynamic ReactJS components.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We successfully built a decentralized journalist platform that empowers users to publish articles on a transparent and secure platform. We are particularly proud of delivering a complete and functioning web application that meets our project goals.
## What we learned
Throughout the course of this project, we acquired a profound comprehension of the Hedera Hashgraph Consensus Service (HCS) and its practical applications. Additionally, we significantly augmented our proficiency in effectively utilizing the MERN Stack, thereby fortifying our skill set in developing robust and scalable web solutions.
## What's next for JDecentral
In the future, we plan to expand the platform's functionality by incorporating better security, live chat and social sharing capabilities. We will continue to refine the user interface and explore additional integrations with Hedera's ecosystem.
